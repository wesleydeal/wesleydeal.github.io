TL;DR: Building a responsive [resume](/resume) taught me that modern web browsers are tremendously flexible without
need for frontend or backend frameworks and can be adapted quite well to typesetting for print, with some caveats.

## The Problem

What is the best way to create a document that:
* can easily be viewed online or in print,
* can be read on a smartphone,
* looks consistently good across platforms,
* allows easy change tracking,
* and can be tweaked on the fly on almost any platform?

For a while, my answer to this question was Google Docs. It runs in a browser on my phone or laptop,
it can export to PDF and to print quite easily, and it can even responsively shrink your page for
reading and writing on mobile.

There are a couple of main problems with this approach for a resume. For one, Google Docs is not
built for responsive design. You can't set breakpoints that change the layout and style of parts
of the page on smaller devices, so you're stuck trying to come up with something that looks good
enough on a small screen without negatively impacting your full-size layout.

Second, Google Docs styles don't cascade. That means that changes to the the or paragraph spacing tend to involve
lots of clicks around the document to ensure that properties are all set the same way.

Third, Google Docs is limited in style and scripting capabilities. I found that ATS scanning my
resume would almost universally fail to handle ligatures like the connected "*ffi*" in *efficient*.
But there's no way to turn these off other than to pick a font that doesn't support them. Or let's
say I would like to add a quick button to change the font to a sans-serif. This type of
interactivity is not what Docs is built for.

So let's try a stack built for responsive design, cascading style sheets, and advanced styling and scripting.

## A Blank Slate

We'll start with the minimum reasonable HTML/CSS file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>My Resume</title>
	<style>
	</style>
	<body>
		<!-- we'll be adding stuff in here next -->
	</body>
</html>
```

We'll structure our resume with semantic elements. Our resume is an article with a header, sections, and a footer.
The sections consist of a top-level heading and then may contain either subheadings or content. Our job titles are
subheadings with unordered lists of accomplishments. We'll use `<summary>` and `<details>` to make them collapsible.
Our education & certifications section has subheadings (we
will want them a bit smaller, so we use a different tag) and optionally some associated details. Our skills section
is just a few paragraphs beginning with a bolded category and a comma-separated list of skills. In the heading,
we want our name and job title in a seperate area from our contact information, so we make them separate `<div>`s.

```html
<header>
	<div id="namebox">
		<p class="name">John Doe
		<p class="jobtitle">Widget Developer
	</div>
	<div id="contact">
		<p><a href="tel:555-555-5555">(555) 555-5555</a>
		<p><a href="mailto:john.doe@example.com">john.doe@example.com</a>
		<p>Anchorage, Alaska
	</div>
</header>
<section id="experience">
	<h1>Work Experience</h1>
	<details open>

Alright, so we have a structure for our resume. Now let's fill in our `<style>`sheet.

```css
