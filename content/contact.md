I can be reached by email at the address:

<span style="font-size: 1.5em">
contactpage@<span style="color: var(--color-hover)">[LastName]</span>.digital
</span>

To help determine what goes after the @ sign, here are some hints:
* it's the domain of the page you're reading now
* it contains last name of the person you're trying to contact
* and after that it contains a full stop and the word digital

I hope you can figure out this complicated puzzle.
